# Forest_fire_pred_project
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting forest fires. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately anticipate the likelihood of a forest fire based on various factors. we use different classification models to predict the output based on given features.
